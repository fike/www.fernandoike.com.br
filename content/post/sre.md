"Ben Treynor, Google Vice President and Site Reliability Tsar, describes SRE as being “what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem”: a software engineering philosophy (“write software to solve problems”) hybridized with an operations mission (“keep the service running”). These two influences can be seen in the dual job titles within SRE— SRE-Systems Engineer and SRE-Software Engineer—reflecting the different emphasis with which individual SREs may approach the same problems: one may be most comfort- able writing new software, while the other may tend to prefer fitting existing components together into new and exciting architectures, but everyone can do some of both."

"We specifically do not look for “architects”—that’s a role that simply doesn’t exist at Google: everyone in our engineering orga- nizations both designs and implements"


"Practices We’ve Found Helpful for Hiring SREs
Structure interviews to cover the topics essential to the SRE role, as appropriate for the candidate’s skills and strengths; assign a specific topic to each interviewer.
◆  Build a pool of interview questions along with “gold standard” responses, to provide a consistent subset of questions across candidates.
◆  Ask about how to build concrete large-scale systems; avoid brainteasers and trivia.
◆  Ask every SRE candidate to code something.
◆  Separate interviewing from hiring decisions.
◆  Make hire/no-hire decisions by a committee of engineers."
